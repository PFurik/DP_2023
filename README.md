Lizard.rar contains compiled version of generator with all the assets needed to run.
Despite my best efforts some features don't work in the compiled version (visible glfw window).
However data generation seems to work fine.
To use python version simply add python files into extracted Lizard.rar main folder where .exe is, then run the main.py.
There is a .yml file in python folder for conda virtual environment
